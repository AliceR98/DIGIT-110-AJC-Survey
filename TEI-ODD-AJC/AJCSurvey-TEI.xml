         <!--Research Questions: 
         How much does AJC exceed the boundaries of the survey form: Can we measure this in lines provided vs. lines of text written?
      How many different educational institutions and roles can we identify in the survey, that might have been important places for social change and integrating blacks and whites?
      
      Try using the <lb/> element to mark the beginnings of AJC's lines if you are representing that.
