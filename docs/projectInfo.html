            <p>This project archived the survey of Anna Julia Cooper, a woman born into the slavery in 1858 during the Civil War era who began her education at 9 years old in Raleigh, North Carolina. She then went on to earn a BA in Mathematics in 1884 and an M.A. for college teaching in 1987 at Oberlin College. In 1925, Mrs. Cooper got her PhD in France, becoming the fourth ever African American woman to earn a PhD.</p>
            <p>The goal of this project was to make the survey she made for African American college students easily accessible and readable in the modern era. For that, we decided to give specific texts. For exmample, we decided to outline the handwritten texts of Mrs. Cooper instead of using cursive, as the former is significantly easier to read.</p>
                <p>This project used XML, alongside XSLT, to write the mark up for the text. The reason is because XML allows you to add important features, such as metamarks to display checkmarks for what she checked off, as well as easy tagging for questions so that those wishing to use the code have an easy time adding upon this project.</p>
