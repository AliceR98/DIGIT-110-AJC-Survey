                  67. Will you give briefly your views of the future of Negro education? (What it should
                  be, what changes might be made in the light of your experience; it's present direction,
                  value, etc., for the development of Negro youth.)      
                  <ins class="hand">
                     I have always stood for that Education that aims at the making 
                     of Men rather than the constructing of machines. If the Negro is a man
                     then what is good for Man, in all its age-old and infinite varieties, is
                     good for him. Why should he be cabined and cribbed with just
                     this or just that for his mental fabulum?

                     who are always whining about them &amp; the whips &amp; slings of prejudice,
                     whether of color or sex, find me neither too calloused to suffer nor too
                     ignorant to know what is due me. Our own men as a group have not inherited
                     traditions of chiv-alry (one sided as it may be among white men) &amp; we
                     women are generally left to do our race battling alone except for empty
                     compliments now &amp; then. Even so, one may make the mistake of looking at
                     race handicaps thro the wrong end of the telescope—imagining that oppression
                     goes only with color. When I encounter brutality I need not always
                     charge it to my race. It may be—&amp; generally is— chargeable to the
                     imperfections in the civilization envisioning me for which as a teacher &amp;
                     trained thinker. I take my share of responsibility.
                     
                     The extent, then, of the optimism in my philosophy is that,
                     (Statisticians &amp; Social Science Research compilers to the contrary
                     notwithstanding) the solution of our problem will be the individual &amp; not
                     en masse, &amp; the habit of generalization &amp; deductive logic has done its
                     worst.
                     
                     For after all, Social Justice the desired goal is not to be reached thro any

                     domineering thumb to over ride &amp; keep down every
                     finger weak enough to give up the struggle. The ballot operates just so far
                     as dominant forces agree to respect it. Which again is reasoning in a circle
                     to insane justice by having man become just. &amp; the spectacle of
                     <span class="gap">image cut off on left margin</span>angsler dominance among ballot holding Americans invites little hope
                     for solution when the element of race is added to the problem. As I see it
                     then, the patient persistence of the individual, working as

                     to give zest to the struggle, just enough hope of scoring <span class="gap">image cut off on left marging</span>somewhere among the winners to keep my head "unbowed tho bloody."</ins>
