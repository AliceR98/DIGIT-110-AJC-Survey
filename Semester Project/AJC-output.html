               Teaching has always seemed to me the noblest of callings, &amp; I believe that if I were
               white I should still want to teach those whose need presents a stronger appeal than
               money. There may
               be a bit of vanity in this. It is human to be stimulated by appreciation where it
               is genuine.

               her graduates were not eligible to try for them. The Director at the same time recommended

            65 cont.) of Pollyanna stuff. I am as sensitive to handicaps as those
            who are always whining about them &amp; the whips &amp; slings of prejudice,
            whether of color or sex, find me neither too calloused to suffer nor too
            ignorant to know what is due me. Our own men as a group have not inherited
            traditions of chiv-alry (one sided as it may be among white men) &amp; we
            women are generally left to do our race battling alone except for empty
            compliments now &amp; then. Even so, one may make the mistake of looking at
            race handicaps thro the wrong end of the telescope—imagining that oppression
            goes only with color. When I encounter brutality I need not always
            charge it to my race. It may be—&amp; generally is— chargeable to the
            imperfections in the civilization envisioning me for which as a teacher &amp;
            trained thinker. I take my share of responsibility.
            
            The extent, then, of the optimism in my philosophy is that,
            (Statisticians &amp; Social Science Research compilers to the contrary
            notwithstanding) the solution of our problem will be the individual &amp; not
            en masse, &amp; the habit of generalization &amp; deductive logic has done its
            worst.
            
            For after all, Social Justice the desired goal is not to be reached thro any
            panacea by mass production. whether <span class="persName">DuBois</span>'s preachment
            of the ballot for &amp; <span class="unclear">intermarriage</span>
            or <span class="persName">Kelly Miller</span>'s one time suggestion of self
            effacement, or even <span class="persName">Booker Washington</span>'s proposal of the
            solid hand &amp; separate fingers. For human selfishness will always arise as
            domineering thumb to over ride &amp; keep down every
            finger weak enough to give up the struggle. The ballot operates just so far
            as dominant forces agree to respect it. Which again is reasoning in a circle
            to insane justice by having man become just. &amp; the spectacle of
            <span class="gap"></span>angsler dominance among ballot holding Americans invites little hope
            for solution when the element of race is added to the problem. As I see it
            then, the patient persistence of the individual, working as
            <span class="persName">Browning</span> has it, "mouth wise &amp; pen
            wise" in whatever station &amp; with whatever talent God has
            given, in truth &amp; loyalty to serve the whole, will come as near as any
            other to proving worth while.
            
            To me Life has meant a big opportunity &amp; I am thankful that my
            work has always been the soul that beckoned me on, leaving no room for blase
            philosophizing &amp; rebellious resentment &amp; with just enough opposition
            to give zest to the struggle, just enough hope of scoring <span class="gap">image cut off on left marging</span>somewhere among the winners to keep my head "unbowed tho bloody."
